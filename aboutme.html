    <h1>Who Moved My Cheese?</h1>
    <p>
        Who Moved My Cheese a parable about two little people and two mice in a maze, searching for cheese,
         where each character represents a different attitude towards change, with cheese being what we 
         consider success.Sniff, Scurry, Hem, and Haw are four characters that live in a dark, elaborate maze, 
         each searching for their own special cheese to nourish them.
